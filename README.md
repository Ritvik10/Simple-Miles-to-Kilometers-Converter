# Simple-Miles-to-Kilometers-Converter
I have made a simple miles to kilometers converter using javascript in a pre defined HTML and CSS code for the converter .

I used the knowledge I gained from the 'Javascript Basics' course on Coursera provided by University of California,Davis in order to make it.

The CSS style used and HTML code are also provided separately and all three are linked together.
